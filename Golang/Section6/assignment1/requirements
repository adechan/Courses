Write a program that creates 2 custom struct types called 'triangle' and 'square'
The square  type should be a struct with a field 'sideLength' of type float64
The triangle type should be a struct with a field 'height' of type float64, and a field of type
'base' of type float64

Both types should have a function called 'getArea' that returns the calculated area of the 
square or triangle

Area of triangle = 0.5 * base * height
Area of square = sideLength * sideLength

Add a 'shape' interface that defines a function 'printArea'
This function should calculate the area of the given shape  and print it out to the
terminal.
Design the interface so that the 'printArea' function can pe called with either a triangle
or square
